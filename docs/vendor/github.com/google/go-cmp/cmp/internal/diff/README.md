Package diff implements an algorithm for producing edit\-scripts. The edit\-script is a sequence of operations needed to transform one list of symbols into another \(or vice\-versa\). The edits allowed are insertions, deletions, and modifications. The summation of all edits is called the Levenshtein distance as this problem is well\-known in computer science.

This package prioritizes performance over accuracy. That is, the run time is more important than obtaining a minimal Levenshtein distance.

## type EditScript

EditScript represents the series of differences between two lists.

```go
type EditScript []EditType
```

### func Difference

```go
func Difference(nx, ny int, f EqualFunc) (es EditScript)
```

Difference reports whether two lists of lengths nx and ny are equal given the definition of equality provided as f.

This function returns an edit\-script, which is a sequence of operations needed to convert one list into the other. The following invariants for the edit\-script are maintained: \- eq == \(es.Dist\(\)==0\) \- nx == es.LenX\(\) \- ny == es.LenY\(\)

This algorithm is not guaranteed to be an optimal solution \(i.e., one that produces an edit\-script with a minimal Levenshtein distance\). This algorithm favors performance over optimality. The exact output is not guaranteed to be stable and may change over time.

### func \(EditScript\) Dist

```go
func (es EditScript) Dist() int
```

Dist is the Levenshtein distance and is guaranteed to be 0 if and only if lists X and Y are equal.

### func \(EditScript\) LenX

```go
func (es EditScript) LenX() int
```

LenX is the length of the X list.

### func \(EditScript\) LenY

```go
func (es EditScript) LenY() int
```

LenY is the length of the Y list.

### func \(EditScript\) String

```go
func (es EditScript) String() string
```

String returns a human\-readable string representing the edit\-script where Identity, UniqueX, UniqueY, and Modified are represented by the '.', 'X', 'Y', and 'M' characters, respectively.

## type EditType

EditType represents a single operation within an edit\-script.

```go
type EditType uint8
```

```go
const (
    // Identity indicates that a symbol pair is identical in both list X and Y.
    Identity EditType = iota
    // UniqueX indicates that a symbol only exists in X and not Y.
    UniqueX
    // UniqueY indicates that a symbol only exists in Y and not X.
    UniqueY
    // Modified indicates that a symbol pair is a modification of each other.
    Modified
)
```

## type EqualFunc

EqualFunc reports whether the symbols at indexes ix and iy are equal. When called by Difference, the index is guaranteed to be within nx and ny.

```go
type EqualFunc func(ix int, iy int) Result
```

## type Result

Result is the result of comparison. NumSame is the number of sub\-elements that are equal. NumDiff is the number of sub\-elements that are not equal.

```go
type Result struct{ NumSame, NumDiff int }
```

### func BoolResult

```go
func BoolResult(b bool) Result
```

BoolResult returns a Result that is either Equal or not Equal.

### func \(Result\) Equal

```go
func (r Result) Equal() bool
```

Equal indicates whether the symbols are equal. Two symbols are equal if and only if NumDiff == 0. If Equal, then they are also Similar.

### func \(Result\) Similar

```go
func (r Result) Similar() bool
```

Similar indicates whether two symbols are similar and may be represented by using the Modified type. As a special case, we consider binary comparisons \(i.e., those that return Result\{1, 0\} or Result\{0, 1\}\) to be similar.

The exact ratio of NumSame to NumDiff to determine similarity may change.
