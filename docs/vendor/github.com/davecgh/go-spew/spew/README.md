# spew

```go
import "github.com/vmware/service-level-indicator-exporter-for-kafka/vendor/github.com/davecgh/go-spew/spew"
```

Package spew implements a deep pretty printer for Go data structures to aid in debugging.

A quick overview of the additional features spew provides over the built\-in printing facilities for Go data types are as follows:

```
* Pointers are dereferenced and followed
* Circular data structures are detected and handled properly
* Custom Stringer/error interfaces are optionally invoked, including
  on unexported types
* Custom types which only implement the Stringer/error interfaces via
  a pointer receiver are optionally invoked when passing non-pointer
  variables
* Byte arrays and slices are dumped like the hexdump -C command which
  includes offsets, byte values in hex, and ASCII output (only when using
  Dump style)
```

There are two different approaches spew allows for dumping Go data structures:

```
* Dump style which prints with newlines, customizable indentation,
  and additional debug information such as types and all pointer addresses
  used to indirect to the final value
* A custom Formatter interface that integrates cleanly with the standard fmt
  package and replaces %v, %+v, %#v, and %#+v to provide inline printing
  similar to the default %v while providing the additional functionality
  outlined above and passing unsupported format verbs such as %x and %q
  along to fmt
```

### Quick Start

This section demonstrates how to quickly get started with spew.  See the sections below for further details on formatting and configuration options.

To dump a variable with full newlines, indentation, type, and pointer information use Dump, Fdump, or Sdump: spew.Dump\(myVar1, myVar2, ...\) spew.Fdump\(someWriter, myVar1, myVar2, ...\) str := spew.Sdump\(myVar1, myVar2, ...\)

Alternatively, if you would prefer to use format strings with a compacted inline printing style, use the convenience wrappers Printf, Fprintf, etc with %v \(most compact\), %\+v \(adds pointer addresses\), %\#v \(adds types\), or %\#\+v \(adds types and pointer addresses\): spew.Printf\("myVar1: %v \-\- myVar2: %\+v", myVar1, myVar2\) spew.Printf\("myVar3: %\#v \-\- myVar4: %\#\+v", myVar3, myVar4\) spew.Fprintf\(someWriter, "myVar1: %v \-\- myVar2: %\+v", myVar1, myVar2\) spew.Fprintf\(someWriter, "myVar3: %\#v \-\- myVar4: %\#\+v", myVar3, myVar4\)

### Configuration Options

Configuration of spew is handled by fields in the ConfigState type.  For convenience, all of the top\-level functions use a global state available via the spew.Config global.

It is also possible to create a ConfigState instance that provides methods equivalent to the top\-level functions.  This allows concurrent configuration options.  See the ConfigState documentation for more details.

The following configuration options are available: \* Indent String to use for each indentation level for Dump functions. It is a single space by default.  A popular alternative is "\\t".

```
* MaxDepth
	Maximum number of levels to descend into nested data structures.
	There is no limit by default.

* DisableMethods
	Disables invocation of error and Stringer interface methods.
	Method invocation is enabled by default.

* DisablePointerMethods
	Disables invocation of error and Stringer interface methods on types
	which only accept pointer receivers from non-pointer variables.
	Pointer method invocation is enabled by default.

* DisablePointerAddresses
	DisablePointerAddresses specifies whether to disable the printing of
	pointer addresses. This is useful when diffing data structures in tests.

* DisableCapacities
	DisableCapacities specifies whether to disable the printing of
	capacities for arrays, slices, maps and channels. This is useful when
	diffing data structures in tests.

* ContinueOnMethod
	Enables recursion into types after invoking error and Stringer interface
	methods. Recursion after method invocation is disabled by default.

* SortKeys
	Specifies map keys should be sorted before being printed. Use
	this to have a more deterministic, diffable output.  Note that
	only native types (bool, int, uint, floats, uintptr and string)
	and types which implement error or Stringer interfaces are
	supported with other types sorted according to the
	reflect.Value.String() output which guarantees display
	stability.  Natural map order is used by default.

* SpewKeys
	Specifies that, as a last resort attempt, map keys should be
	spewed to strings and sorted by those strings.  This is only
	considered if SortKeys is true.
```

### Dump Usage

Simply call spew.Dump with a list of variables you want to dump:

```
spew.Dump(myVar1, myVar2, ...)
```

You may also call spew.Fdump if you would prefer to output to an arbitrary io.Writer.  For example, to dump to standard error:

```
spew.Fdump(os.Stderr, myVar1, myVar2, ...)
```

A third option is to call spew.Sdump to get the formatted output as a string:

```
str := spew.Sdump(myVar1, myVar2, ...)
```

### Sample Dump Output

See the Dump example for details on the setup of the types and variables being shown here.

```
(main.Foo) {
 unexportedField: (*main.Bar)(0xf84002e210)({
  flag: (main.Flag) flagTwo,
  data: (uintptr) <nil>
 }),
 ExportedField: (map[interface {}]interface {}) (len=1) {
  (string) (len=3) "one": (bool) true
 }
}
```

Byte \(and uint8\) arrays and slices are displayed uniquely like the hexdump \-C command as shown. \(\[\]uint8\) \(len=32 cap=32\) \{ 00000000  11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18  19 1a 1b 1c 1d 1e 1f 20  |............... | 00000010  21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28  29 2a 2b 2c 2d 2e 2f 30  |\!"\#$%&'\(\)\*\+,\-./0| 00000020  31 32                                             |12| \}

### Custom Formatter

Spew provides a custom formatter that implements the fmt.Formatter interface so that it integrates cleanly with standard fmt package printing functions. The formatter is useful for inline printing of smaller data types similar to the standard %v format specifier.

The custom formatter only responds to the %v \(most compact\), %\+v \(adds pointer addresses\), %\#v \(adds types\), or %\#\+v \(adds types and pointer addresses\) verb combinations.  Any other verbs such as %x and %q will be sent to the the standard fmt package for formatting.  In addition, the custom formatter ignores the width and precision arguments \(however they will still work on the format specifiers not handled by the custom formatter\).

### Custom Formatter Usage

The simplest way to make use of the spew custom formatter is to call one of the convenience functions such as spew.Printf, spew.Println, or spew.Printf.  The functions have syntax you are most likely already familiar with:

```
spew.Printf("myVar1: %v -- myVar2: %+v", myVar1, myVar2)
spew.Printf("myVar3: %#v -- myVar4: %#+v", myVar3, myVar4)
spew.Println(myVar, myVar2)
spew.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "myVar1: %v -- myVar2: %+v", myVar1, myVar2)
spew.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "myVar3: %#v -- myVar4: %#+v", myVar3, myVar4)
```

See the Index for the full list convenience functions.

### Sample Formatter Output

Double pointer to a uint8: %v: \<\*\*\>5 %\+v: \<\*\*\>\(0xf8400420d0\-\>0xf8400420c8\)5 %\#v: \(\*\*uint8\)5 %\#\+v: \(\*\*uint8\)\(0xf8400420d0\-\>0xf8400420c8\)5

Pointer to circular struct with a uint8 field and a pointer to itself: %v: \<\*\>\{1 \<\*\>\<shown\>\} %\+v: \<\*\>\(0xf84003e260\)\{ui8:1 c:\<\*\>\(0xf84003e260\)\<shown\>\} %\#v: \(\*main.circular\)\{ui8:\(uint8\)1 c:\(\*main.circular\)\<shown\>\} %\#\+v: \(\*main.circular\)\(0xf84003e260\)\{ui8:\(uint8\)1 c:\(\*main.circular\)\(0xf84003e260\)\<shown\>\}

See the Printf example for details on the setup of variables being shown here.

### Errors

Since it is possible for custom Stringer/error interfaces to panic, spew detects them and handles them internally by printing the panic information inline with the output.  Since spew is intended to provide deep pretty printing capabilities on structures, it intentionally does not return any errors.

## type ConfigState

ConfigState houses the configuration options used by spew to format and display values.  There is a global instance, Config, that is used to control all top\-level Formatter and Dump functionality.  Each ConfigState instance provides methods equivalent to the top\-level functions.

The zero value for ConfigState provides no indentation.  You would typically want to set it to a space or a tab.

Alternatively, you can use NewDefaultConfig to get a ConfigState instance with default settings.  See the documentation of NewDefaultConfig for default values.

```go
type ConfigState struct {
    // Indent specifies the string to use for each indentation level.  The
    // global config instance that all top-level functions use set this to a
    // single space by default.  If you would like more indentation, you might
    // set this to a tab with "\t" or perhaps two spaces with "  ".
    Indent string

    // MaxDepth controls the maximum number of levels to descend into nested
    // data structures.  The default, 0, means there is no limit.
    //
    // NOTE: Circular data structures are properly detected, so it is not
    // necessary to set this value unless you specifically want to limit deeply
    // nested data structures.
    MaxDepth int

    // DisableMethods specifies whether or not error and Stringer interfaces are
    // invoked for types that implement them.
    DisableMethods bool

    // DisablePointerMethods specifies whether or not to check for and invoke
    // error and Stringer interfaces on types which only accept a pointer
    // receiver when the current type is not a pointer.
    //
    // NOTE: This might be an unsafe action since calling one of these methods
    // with a pointer receiver could technically mutate the value, however,
    // in practice, types which choose to satisify an error or Stringer
    // interface with a pointer receiver should not be mutating their state
    // inside these interface methods.  As a result, this option relies on
    // access to the unsafe package, so it will not have any effect when
    // running in environments without access to the unsafe package such as
    // Google App Engine or with the "safe" build tag specified.
    DisablePointerMethods bool

    // DisablePointerAddresses specifies whether to disable the printing of
    // pointer addresses. This is useful when diffing data structures in tests.
    DisablePointerAddresses bool

    // DisableCapacities specifies whether to disable the printing of capacities
    // for arrays, slices, maps and channels. This is useful when diffing
    // data structures in tests.
    DisableCapacities bool

    // ContinueOnMethod specifies whether or not recursion should continue once
    // a custom error or Stringer interface is invoked.  The default, false,
    // means it will print the results of invoking the custom error or Stringer
    // interface and return immediately instead of continuing to recurse into
    // the internals of the data type.
    //
    // NOTE: This flag does not have any effect if method invocation is disabled
    // via the DisableMethods or DisablePointerMethods options.
    ContinueOnMethod bool

    // SortKeys specifies map keys should be sorted before being printed. Use
    // this to have a more deterministic, diffable output.  Note that only
    // native types (bool, int, uint, floats, uintptr and string) and types
    // that support the error or Stringer interfaces (if methods are
    // enabled) are supported, with other types sorted according to the
    // reflect.Value.String() output which guarantees display stability.
    SortKeys bool

    // SpewKeys specifies that, as a last resort attempt, map keys should
    // be spewed to strings and sorted by those strings.  This is only
    // considered if SortKeys is true.
    SpewKeys bool
}

### func \(\*ConfigState\) Sprintln

```go
func (c *ConfigState) Sprintln(a ...interface{}) string
```

Sprintln is a wrapper for fmt.Sprintln that treats each argument as if it were passed with a Formatter interface returned by c.NewFormatter.  It returns the resulting string.  See NewFormatter for formatting details.

This function is shorthand for the following syntax:

```
fmt.Sprintln(c.NewFormatter(a), c.NewFormatter(b))
```
