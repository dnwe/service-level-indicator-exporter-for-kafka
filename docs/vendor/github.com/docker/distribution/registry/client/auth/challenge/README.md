## type Challenge

Challenge carries information from a WWW\-Authenticate response header. See RFC 2617.

```go
type Challenge struct {
    // Scheme is the auth-scheme according to RFC 2617
    Scheme string

    // Parameters are the auth-params according to RFC 2617
    Parameters map[string]string
}
```

### func ResponseChallenges

```go
func ResponseChallenges(resp *http.Response) []Challenge
```

ResponseChallenges returns a list of authorization challenges for the given http Response. Challenges are only checked if the response status code was a 401.

## type Manager

Manager manages the challenges for endpoints. The challenges are pulled out of HTTP responses. Only responses which expect challenges should be added to the manager, since a non\-unauthorized request will be viewed as not requiring challenges.

```go
type Manager interface {
    // GetChallenges returns the challenges for the given
    // endpoint URL.
    GetChallenges(endpoint url.URL) ([]Challenge, error)

    // AddResponse adds the response to the challenge
    // manager. The challenges will be parsed out of
    // the WWW-Authenicate headers and added to the
    // URL which was produced the response. If the
    // response was authorized, any challenges for the
    // endpoint will be cleared.
    AddResponse(resp *http.Response) error
}
```

### func NewSimpleManager

```go
func NewSimpleManager() Manager
```

NewSimpleManager returns an instance of Manger which only maps endpoints to challenges based on the responses which have been added the manager. The simple manager will make no attempt to perform requests on the endpoints or cache the responses to a backend.
