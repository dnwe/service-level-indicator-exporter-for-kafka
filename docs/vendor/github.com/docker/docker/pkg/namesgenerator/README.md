```

Package namesgenerator generates random names.

This package is officially "frozen" \- no new additions will be accepted.

For a long time, this package provided a lot of joy within the project, but at some point the conflicts of opinion became greater than the added joy.

At some future time, this may be replaced with something that sparks less controversy, but for now it will remain as\-is.

## func GetRandomName

```go
func GetRandomName(retry int) string
```

GetRandomName generates a random name from the list of adjectives and surnames in this package formatted as "adjective\_surname". For example 'focused\_turing'. If retry is non\-zero, a random integer between 0 and 10 will be added to the end of the name, e.g \`focused\_turing3\`
