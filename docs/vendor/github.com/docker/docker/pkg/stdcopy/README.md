- [func NewStdWriter(w io.Writer, t StdType) io.Writer](<#func-newstdwriter>)
- [func StdCopy(dstout, dsterr io.Writer, src io.Reader) (written int64, err error)](<#func-stdcopy>)

## func NewStdWriter

```go
func NewStdWriter(w io.Writer, t StdType) io.Writer
```

NewStdWriter instantiates a new Writer. Everything written to it will be encapsulated using a custom format, and written to the underlying \`w\` stream. This allows multiple write streams \(e.g. stdout and stderr\) to be muxed into a single connection. \`t\` indicates the id of the stream to encapsulate. It can be stdcopy.Stdin, stdcopy.Stdout, stdcopy.Stderr.

## func StdCopy

```go
func StdCopy(dstout, dsterr io.Writer, src io.Reader) (written int64, err error)
```

StdCopy is a modified version of io.Copy.

StdCopy will demultiplex \`src\`, assuming that it contains two streams, previously multiplexed together using a StdWriter instance. As it reads from \`src\`, StdCopy will write to \`dstout\` and \`dsterr\`.

StdCopy will read until it hits EOF on \`src\`. It will then return a nil error. In other words: if \`err\` is non nil, it indicates a real underlying error.

\`written\` will hold the total number of bytes written to \`dstout\` and \`dsterr\`.

## type StdType

StdType is the type of standard stream a writer can multiplex to.

```go
type StdType byte
```

```go
const (
    // Stdin represents standard input stream type.
    Stdin StdType = iota
    // Stdout represents standard output stream type.
    Stdout
    // Stderr represents standard error steam type.
    Stderr
    // Systemerr represents errors originating from the system that make it
    // into the multiplexed stream.
    Systemerr
)
```
