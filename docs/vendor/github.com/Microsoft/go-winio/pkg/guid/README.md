- [type GUID](<#type-guid>)


## type GUID

GUID represents a GUID/UUID. It has the same structure as golang.org/x/sys/windows.GUID so that it can be used with functions expecting that type. It is defined as its own type as that is only available to builds targeted at \`windows\`. The representation matches that used by native Windows code.

```go
type GUID struct {
    Data1 uint32
    Data2 uint16
    Data3 uint16
    Data4 [8]byte
}
```
