## Variables

```go
var (
    // ErrInvalid is returned when there is an invalid reference
    ErrInvalid = errors.New("invalid reference")
    // ErrObjectRequired is returned when the object is required
    ErrObjectRequired = errors.New("object required")
    // ErrHostnameRequired is returned when the hostname is required
    ErrHostnameRequired = errors.New("hostname required")
)
```

## func SplitObject

```go
func SplitObject(obj string) (tag string, dgst digest.Digest)
```

SplitObject provides two parts of the object spec, delimited by an \`@\` symbol.

Either may be empty and it is the callers job to validate them appropriately.

## type Spec

Spec defines the main components of a reference specification.

A reference specification is a schema\-less URI parsed into common components. The two main components, locator and object, are required to be supported by remotes. It represents a superset of the naming define in docker's reference schema. It aims to be compatible but not prescriptive.

While the interpretation of the components, locator and object, are up to the remote, we define a few common parts, accessible via helper methods.

The first is the hostname, which is part of the locator. This doesn't need to map to a physical resource, but it must parse as a hostname. We refer to this as the namespace.

The other component made accessible by helper method is the digest. This is part of the object identifier, always prefixed with an '@'. If present, the remote may use the digest portion directly or resolve it against a prefix. If the object does not include the \`@\` symbol, the return value for \`Digest\` will be empty.

```go
type Spec struct {
    // Locator is the host and path portion of the specification. The host
    // portion may refer to an actual host or just a namespace of related
    // images.
    //
    // Typically, the locator may used to resolve the remote to fetch specific
    // resources.
    Locator string

    // Object contains the identifier for the remote resource. Classically,
    // this is a tag but can refer to anything in a remote. By convention, any
    // portion that may be a partial or whole digest will be preceded by an
    // `@`. Anything preceding the `@` will be referred to as the "tag".
    //
    // In practice, we will see this broken down into the following formats:
    //
    // 1. <tag>
    // 2. <tag>@<digest spec>
    // 3. @<digest spec>
    //
    // We define the tag to be anything except '@' and ':'. <digest spec> may
    // be a full valid digest or shortened version, possibly with elided
    // algorithm.
    Object string
}
```

### func Parse

```go
func Parse(s string) (Spec, error)
```

Parse parses the string into a structured ref.

### func \(Spec\) Digest

```go
func (r Spec) Digest() digest.Digest
```

Digest returns the digest portion of the reference spec. This may be a partial or invalid digest, which may be used to lookup a complete digest.

### func \(Spec\) Hostname

```go
func (r Spec) Hostname() string
```

Hostname returns the hostname portion of the locator.

Remotes are not required to directly access the resources at this host. This method is provided for convenience.

### func \(Spec\) String

```go
func (r Spec) String() string
```

String returns the normalized string for the ref.
