# sortorder

```go
import "github.com/fvbommel/sortorder"
```

Package sortorder implements sort orders and comparison functions.

Currently, it only implements so\-called "natural order", where integers embedded in strings are compared by value.

## Index

- [func NaturalLess(str1, str2 string) bool](<#func-naturalless>)
- [type Natural](<#type-natural>)
  - [func (n Natural) Len() int](<#func-natural-len>)
  - [func (n Natural) Less(i, j int) bool](<#func-natural-less>)
  - [func (n Natural) Swap(i, j int)](<#func-natural-swap>)


## func NaturalLess

```go
func NaturalLess(str1, str2 string) bool
```

NaturalLess compares two strings using natural ordering. This means that e.g. "abc2" \< "abc12".

Non\-digit sequences and numbers are compared separately. The former are compared bytewise, while the latter are compared numerically \(except that the number of leading zeros is used as a tie\-breaker, so e.g. "2" \< "02"\)

Limitation: only ASCII digits \(0\-9\) are considered.

## type Natural

Natural implements sort.Interface to sort strings in natural order. This means that e.g. "abc2" \< "abc12".

Non\-digit sequences and numbers are compared separately. The former are compared bytewise, while the latter are compared numerically \(except that the number of leading zeros is used as a tie\-breaker, so e.g. "2" \< "02"\)

Limitation: only ASCII digits \(0\-9\) are considered.

```go
type Natural []string
```

### func \(Natural\) Len

```go
func (n Natural) Len() int
```

### func \(Natural\) Less

```go
func (n Natural) Less(i, j int) bool
```

### func \(Natural\) Swap

```go
func (n Natural) Swap(i, j int)
```
