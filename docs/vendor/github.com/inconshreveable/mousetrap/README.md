## func StartedByExplorer

```go
func StartedByExplorer() bool
```

StartedByExplorer returns true if the program was invoked by the user double\-clicking on the executable from explorer.exe

It is conservative and returns false if any of the internal calls fail. It does not guarantee that the program was run from a terminal. It only can tell you whether it was launched from explorer.exe

On non\-Windows platforms, it always returns false.
