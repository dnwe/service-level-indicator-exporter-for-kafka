## Constants

application wide constants

```go

    PrivDir = "private"
    // RootKeysSubdir is the subdirectory under PrivDir where root private keys are stored
    // DEPRECATED: The only reason we need this constant is compatibility with older versions
    RootKeysSubdir = "root_keys"
    // NonRootKeysSubdir is the subdirectory under PrivDir where non-root private keys are stored
    // DEPRECATED: The only reason we need this constant is compatibility with older versions
    NonRootKeysSubdir = "tuf_keys"
    // KeyExtension is the file extension to use for private key files
    KeyExtension = "key"

    // Day is a duration of one day
    Day  = 24 * time.Hour
    Year = 365 * Day

    // NotaryRootExpiry is the duration representing the expiry time of the Root role
    NotaryRootExpiry      = 10 * Year
    NotaryTargetsExpiry   = 3 * Year
    NotarySnapshotExpiry  = 3 * Year
    NotaryTimestampExpiry = 14 * Day

    ConsistentMetadataCacheMaxAge = 30 * Day
    CurrentMetadataCacheMaxAge    = 5 * time.Minute
    // CacheMaxAgeLimit is the generally recommended maximum age for Cache-Control headers
    // (one year, in seconds, since one year is forever in terms of internet
    // content)

    MemoryBackend    = "memory"
    PostgresBackend  = "postgres"
    SQLiteBackend    = "sqlite3"
    RethinkDBBackend = "rethinkdb"
    FileBackend      = "file"

    DefaultImportRole = "delegation"

    // HealthCheckKeyManagement and HealthCheckSigner are the grpc service name
    // for "KeyManagement" and "Signer" respectively which used for health check.

## Variables

NotarySupportedBackends contains the backends we would like to support at present

```go
var NotarySupportedBackends = []string{
    MemoryBackend,
    MySQLBackend,
    SQLiteBackend,
    RethinkDBBackend,
    PostgresBackend,
}
```

NotarySupportedSignals contains the signals we would like to capture: \- SIGUSR1, indicates a increment of the log level. \- SIGUSR2, indicates a decrement of the log level.

```go
var NotarySupportedSignals = []os.Signal{
    syscall.SIGUSR1,
    syscall.SIGUSR2,
}
```

## func FIPSEnabled

```go
func FIPSEnabled() bool
```

FIPSEnabled returns true if running in FIPS mode. If compiled in FIPS mode the md5 hash function is never available even when imported. This seems to be the best test we have for it.

## type CtxKey

CtxKey is a wrapper type for use in context.WithValue\(\) to satisfy golint https://github.com/golang/go/issues/17293 https://github.com/golang/lint/pull/245

```go
type CtxKey int
```

enum to use for setting and retrieving values from contexts

```go
const (
    CtxKeyMetaStore CtxKey = iota
    CtxKeyKeyAlgo
    CtxKeyCryptoSvc
    CtxKeyRepo
)
```

## type PassRetriever

PassRetriever is a callback function that should retrieve a passphrase for a given named key. If it should be treated as new passphrase \(e.g. with confirmation\), createNew will be true. Attempts is passed in so that implementers decide how many chances to give to a human, for example.

```go
type PassRetriever func(keyName, alias string, createNew bool, attempts int) (passphrase string, giveup bool, err error)
```
