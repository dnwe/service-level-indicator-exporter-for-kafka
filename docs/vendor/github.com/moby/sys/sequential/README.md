# sequential

```go
import "github.com/vmware/service-level-indicator-exporter-for-kafka/vendor/github.com/moby/sys/sequential"
```

Package sequential provides a set of functions for managing sequential files on Windows.

The origin of these functions are the golang OS and windows packages, slightly modified to only cope with files, not directories due to the specific use case.

The alteration is to allow a file on Windows to be opened with FILE\_FLAG\_SEQUENTIAL\_SCAN \(particular for docker load\), to avoid eating the standby list, particularly when accessing large files such as layer.tar.

For non\-Windows platforms, the package provides wrappers for the equivalents in the os packages. They are passthrough on Unix platforms, and only relevant on Windows.

## Index

- [func Create(name string) (*os.File, error)](<#func-create>)
- [func CreateTemp(dir, prefix string) (f *os.File, err error)](<#func-createtemp>)
- [func Open(name string) (*os.File, error)](<#func-open>)
- [func OpenFile(name string, flag int, perm os.FileMode) (*os.File, error)](<#func-openfile>)


## func Create

```go
func Create(name string) (*os.File, error)
```

Create creates the named file with mode 0666 \(before umask\), truncating it if it already exists. If successful, methods on the returned File can be used for I/O; the associated file descriptor has mode O\_RDWR. If there is an error, it will be of type \*PathError.

## func CreateTemp

```go
func CreateTemp(dir, prefix string) (f *os.File, err error)
```

CreateTemp creates a new temporary file in the directory dir with a name beginning with prefix, opens the file for reading and writing, and returns the resulting \*os.File. If dir is the empty string, TempFile uses the default directory for temporary files \(see os.TempDir\). Multiple programs calling TempFile simultaneously will not choose the same file. The caller can use f.Name\(\) to find the pathname of the file. It is the caller's responsibility to remove the file when no longer needed.

## func Open

```go
func Open(name string) (*os.File, error)
```

Open opens the named file for reading. If successful, methods on the returned file can be used for reading; the associated file descriptor has mode O\_RDONLY. If there is an error, it will be of type \*PathError.

## func OpenFile

```go
func OpenFile(name string, flag int, perm os.FileMode) (*os.File, error)
```

OpenFile is the generalized open call; most users will use Open or Create instead. It opens the named file with specified flag \(O\_RDONLY etc.\) and perm, \(0666 etc.\) if applicable. If successful, methods on the returned File can be used for I/O. If there is an error, it will be of type \*PathError.
