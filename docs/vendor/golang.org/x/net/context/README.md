# context

```go
import "golang.org/x/net/context"
```

Package context defines the Context type, which carries deadlines, cancelation signals, and other request\-scoped values across API boundaries and between processes. As of Go 1.7 this package is available in the standard library under the name context.  https://golang.org/pkg/context.

Incoming requests to a server should create a Context, and outgoing calls to servers should accept a Context. The chain of function calls between must propagate the Context, optionally replacing it with a modified copy created using WithDeadline, WithTimeout, WithCancel, or WithValue.

Programs that use Contexts should follow these rules to keep interfaces consistent across packages and enable static analysis tools to check context propagation:

Do not store Contexts inside a struct type; instead, pass a Context explicitly to each function that needs it. The Context should be the first parameter, typically named ctx:

```
func DoSomething(ctx context.Context, arg Arg) error {
	// ... use ctx ...
}
```

Do not pass a nil Context, even if a function permits it. Pass context.TODO if you are unsure about which Context to use.

Use context Values only for request\-scoped data that transits processes and APIs, not for passing optional parameters to functions.

The same Context may be passed to functions running in different goroutines; Contexts are safe for simultaneous use by multiple goroutines.

See http://blog.golang.org/context for example code for a server that uses Contexts.

## Variables

Canceled is the error returned by Context.Err when the context is canceled.

```go
var Canceled = context.Canceled
```

DeadlineExceeded is the error returned by Context.Err when the context's deadline passes.

```go
var DeadlineExceeded = context.DeadlineExceeded
```

## func WithCancel

```go
func WithCancel(parent Context) (ctx Context, cancel CancelFunc)
```

WithCancel returns a copy of parent with a new Done channel. The returned context's Done channel is closed when the returned cancel function is called or when the parent context's Done channel is closed, whichever happens first.

Canceling this context releases resources associated with it, so code should call cancel as soon as the operations running in this Context complete.

## func WithDeadline

```go
func WithDeadline(parent Context, deadline time.Time) (Context, CancelFunc)
```

WithDeadline returns a copy of the parent context with the deadline adjusted to be no later than d. If the parent's deadline is already earlier than d, WithDeadline\(parent, d\) is semantically equivalent to parent. The returned context's Done channel is closed when the deadline expires, when the returned cancel function is called, or when the parent context's Done channel is closed, whichever happens first.

Canceling this context releases resources associated with it, so code should call cancel as soon as the operations running in this Context complete.

## func WithTimeout

```go
func WithTimeout(parent Context, timeout time.Duration) (Context, CancelFunc)
```

WithTimeout returns WithDeadline\(parent, time.Now\(\).Add\(timeout\)\).

Canceling this context releases resources associated with it, so code should call cancel as soon as the operations running in this Context complete:

```
func slowOperationWithTimeout(ctx context.Context) (Result, error) {
	ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(ctx, 100*time.Millisecond)
	defer cancel()  // releases resources if slowOperation completes before timeout elapses
	return slowOperation(ctx)
}
```

## type CancelFunc

A CancelFunc tells an operation to abandon its work. A CancelFunc does not wait for the work to stop. After the first call, subsequent calls to a CancelFunc do nothing.

```go
type CancelFunc = context.CancelFunc
```

## type Context

A Context carries a deadline, a cancelation signal, and other values across API boundaries.

Context's methods may be called by multiple goroutines simultaneously.

```go
type Context = context.Context
```

### func Background

```go
func Background() Context
```

Background returns a non\-nil, empty Context. It is never canceled, has no values, and has no deadline. It is typically used by the main function, initialization, and tests, and as the top\-level Context for incoming requests.

### func TODO

```go
func TODO() Context
```

TODO returns a non\-nil, empty Context. Code should use context.TODO when it's unclear which Context to use or it is not yet available \(because the surrounding function has not yet been extended to accept a Context parameter\).  TODO is recognized by static analysis tools that determine whether Contexts are propagated correctly in a program.

### func WithValue

```go
func WithValue(parent Context, key interface{}, val interface{}) Context
```

WithValue returns a copy of parent in which the value associated with key is val.

Use context Values only for request\-scoped data that transits processes and APIs, not for passing optional parameters to functions.
