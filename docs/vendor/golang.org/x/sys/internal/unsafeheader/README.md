# unsafeheader

```go
import "github.com/vmware/service-level-indicator-exporter-for-kafka/vendor/golang.org/x/sys/internal/unsafeheader"
```

Package unsafeheader contains header declarations for the Go runtime's slice and string implementations.

This package allows x/sys to use types equivalent to reflect.SliceHeader and reflect.StringHeader without introducing a dependency on the \(relatively heavy\) "reflect" package.

## Index

- [type Slice](<#type-slice>)
- [type String](<#type-string>)


## type Slice

Slice is the runtime representation of a slice. It cannot be used safely or portably and its representation may change in a later release.

```go
type Slice struct {
    Data unsafe.Pointer
    Len  int
    Cap  int
}
```

## type String

String is the runtime representation of a string. It cannot be used safely or portably and its representation may change in a later release.

```go
type String struct {
    Data unsafe.Pointer
    Len  int
}
```
