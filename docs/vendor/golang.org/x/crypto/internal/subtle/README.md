# subtle

```go
import "golang.org/x/crypto/internal/subtle"
```

Package subtle implements functions that are often useful in cryptographic code but require careful thought to use correctly.

## Index

- [func AnyOverlap(x, y []byte) bool](<#func-anyoverlap>)
- [func InexactOverlap(x, y []byte) bool](<#func-inexactoverlap>)


## func AnyOverlap

```go
func AnyOverlap(x, y []byte) bool
```

AnyOverlap reports whether x and y share memory at any \(not necessarily corresponding\) index. The memory beyond the slice length is ignored.

## func InexactOverlap

```go
func InexactOverlap(x, y []byte) bool
```

InexactOverlap reports whether x and y share memory at any non\-corresponding index. The memory beyond the slice length is ignored. Note that x and y can have different lengths and still not have any inexact overlap.

InexactOverlap can be used to implement the requirements of the crypto/cipher AEAD, Block, BlockMode and Stream interfaces.
