## type Event

Event represents a one\-time event that may occur in the future.

```go
type Event struct {
    // contains filtered or unexported fields
}
```

### func NewEvent

```go
func NewEvent() *Event
```

NewEvent returns a new, ready\-to\-use Event.

### func \(\*Event\) Done

```go
func (e *Event) Done() <-chan struct{}
```

Done returns a channel that will be closed when Fire is called.

### func \(\*Event\) Fire

```go
func (e *Event) Fire() bool
```

Fire causes e to complete.  It is safe to call multiple times, and concurrently.  It returns true iff this call to Fire caused the signaling channel returned by Done to close.

### func \(\*Event\) HasFired

```go
func (e *Event) HasFired() bool
```

HasFired returns true if Fire has been called.
