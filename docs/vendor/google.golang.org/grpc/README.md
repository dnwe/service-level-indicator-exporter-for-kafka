## Constants

The SupportPackageIsVersion variables are referenced from generated protocol buffer files to ensure compatibility with the gRPC version used.  The latest support package version is 7.

Older versions are kept for compatibility.

These constants should not be referenced from any other code.

```go
const (
    SupportPackageIsVersion3 = true
    SupportPackageIsVersion4 = true
    SupportPackageIsVersion5 = true
    SupportPackageIsVersion6 = true
    SupportPackageIsVersion7 = true
)
```

PickFirstBalancerName is the name of the pick\_first balancer.

```go
const PickFirstBalancerName = "pick_first"
```

Version is the current grpc version.

```go
const Version = "1.50.1"
```

## Variables

DefaultBackoffConfig uses values specified for backoff in https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/connection-backoff.md.

Deprecated: use ConnectParams instead. Will be supported throughout 1.x.

```go
var DefaultBackoffConfig = BackoffConfig{
    MaxDelay: 120 * time.Second,
}
```

EnableTracing controls whether to trace RPCs using the golang.org/x/net/trace package. This should only be set before any RPCs are sent or received by this program.

```go
var EnableTracing bool
```

```go
var (
    // ErrClientConnClosing indicates that the operation is illegal because
    // the ClientConn is closing.
    //
    // Deprecated: this error should not be relied upon by users; use the status
    // code of Canceled instead.
    ErrClientConnClosing = status.Error(codes.Canceled, "grpc: the client connection is closing")
)
```

ErrClientConnTimeout indicates that the ClientConn cannot establish the underlying connections within the specified timeout.

Deprecated: This error is never returned by grpc and should not be referenced by users.

```go
var ErrClientConnTimeout = errors.New("grpc: timed out when dialing")
```

ErrServerStopped indicates that the operation is now illegal because of the server being stopped.

```go
var ErrServerStopped = errors.New("grpc: the server has been stopped")
```

## func Code

```go
func Code(err error) codes.Code
```

Code returns the error code for err if it was produced by the rpc system. Otherwise, it returns codes.Unknown.

Deprecated: use status.Code instead.

## func ErrorDesc

```go
func ErrorDesc(err error) string
```

ErrorDesc returns the error description of err if it was produced by the rpc system. Otherwise, it returns err.Error\(\) or empty string when err is nil.

Deprecated: use status.Convert and Message method instead.

## func Errorf

```go
func Errorf(c codes.Code, format string, a ...interface{}) error
```

Errorf returns an error containing an error code and a description; Errorf returns nil if c is OK.

Deprecated: use status.Errorf instead.

## func Invoke

```go
func Invoke(ctx context.Context, method string, args, reply interface{}, cc *ClientConn, opts ...CallOption) error
```

Invoke sends the RPC request on the wire and returns after response is received.  This is typically called by generated code.

DEPRECATED: Use ClientConn.Invoke instead.

## func Method

```go
func Method(ctx context.Context) (string, bool)
```

Method returns the method string for the server context.  The returned string is in the format of "/service/method".

## func MethodFromServerStream

```go
func MethodFromServerStream(stream ServerStream) (string, bool)
```

MethodFromServerStream returns the method string for the input stream. The returned string is in the format of "/service/method".

## func NewContextWithServerTransportStream

```go
func NewContextWithServerTransportStream(ctx context.Context, stream ServerTransportStream) context.Context
```

NewContextWithServerTransportStream creates a new context from ctx and attaches stream to it.

\# Experimental

Notice: This API is EXPERIMENTAL and may be changed or removed in a later release.

## func SendHeader

```go
func SendHeader(ctx context.Context, md metadata.MD) error
```

SendHeader sends header metadata. It may be called at most once, and may not be called after any event that causes headers to be sent \(see SetHeader for a complete list\).  The provided md and headers set by SetHeader\(\) will be sent.

The error returned is compatible with the status package.  However, the status code will often not match the RPC status as seen by the client application, and therefore, should not be relied upon for this purpose.

## func SetHeader

```go
func SetHeader(ctx context.Context, md metadata.MD) error
```

SetHeader sets the header metadata to be sent from the server to the client. The context provided must be the context passed to the server's handler.

Streaming RPCs should prefer the SetHeader method of the ServerStream.

When called multiple times, all the provided metadata will be merged.  All the metadata will be sent out when one of the following happens:

```
- grpc.SendHeader is called, or for streaming handlers, stream.SendHeader.
- The first response message is sent.  For unary handlers, this occurs when
  the handler returns; for streaming handlers, this can happen when stream's
  SendMsg method is called.
- An RPC status is sent out (error or success).  This occurs when the handler
  returns.
```

SetHeader will fail if called after any of the events above.

The error returned is compatible with the status package.  However, the status code will often not match the RPC status as seen by the client application, and therefore, should not be relied upon for this purpose.

## func SetTrailer

```go
func SetTrailer(ctx context.Context, md metadata.MD) error
```

SetTrailer sets the trailer metadata that will be sent when an RPC returns. When called more than once, all the provided metadata will be merged.

The error returned is compatible with the status package.  However, the status code will often not match the RPC status as seen by the client application, and therefore, should not be relied upon for this purpose.

## type BackoffConfig

BackoffConfig defines the parameters for the default gRPC backoff strategy.

Deprecated: use ConnectParams instead. Will be supported throughout 1.x.

```go
type BackoffConfig struct {
    // MaxDelay is the upper bound of backoff delay.
    MaxDelay time.Duration
}
```

## type CallOption

CallOption configures a Call before it starts or extracts information from a Call after it completes.

```go
type CallOption interface {
    // contains filtered or unexported methods
}
```

### func CallContentSubtype

```go
func CallContentSubtype(contentSubtype string) CallOption
```

CallContentSubtype returns a CallOption that will set the content\-subtype for a call. For example, if content\-subtype is "json", the Content\-Type over the wire will be "application/grpc\+json". The content\-subtype is converted to lowercase before being included in Content\-Type. See Content\-Type on https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/PROTOCOL-HTTP2.md#requests for more details.

If ForceCodec is not also used, the content\-subtype will be used to look up the Codec to use in the registry controlled by RegisterCodec. See the documentation on RegisterCodec for details on registration. The lookup of content\-subtype is case\-insensitive. If no such Codec is found, the call will result in an error with code codes.Internal.

If ForceCodec is also used, that Codec will be used for all request and response messages, with the content\-subtype set to the given contentSubtype here for requests.

### func CallCustomCodec

```go
func CallCustomCodec(codec Codec) CallOption
```

CallCustomCodec behaves like ForceCodec, but accepts a grpc.Codec instead of an encoding.Codec.

Deprecated: use ForceCodec instead.

### func FailFast

```go
func FailFast(failFast bool) CallOption
```

FailFast is the opposite of WaitForReady.

Deprecated: use WaitForReady.

### func ForceCodec

```go
func ForceCodec(codec encoding.Codec) CallOption
```

ForceCodec returns a CallOption that will set codec to be used for all request and response messages for a call. The result of calling Name\(\) will be used as the content\-subtype after converting to lowercase, unless CallContentSubtype is also used.

See Content\-Type on https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/PROTOCOL-HTTP2.md#requests for more details. Also see the documentation on RegisterCodec and CallContentSubtype for more details on the interaction between Codec and content\-subtype.

This function is provided for advanced users; prefer to use only CallContentSubtype to select a registered codec instead.

#### Experimental

Notice: This API is EXPERIMENTAL and may be changed or removed in a later release.

### func Header

```go
func Header(md *metadata.MD) CallOption
```

Header returns a CallOptions that retrieves the header metadata for a unary RPC.

### func MaxCallRecvMsgSize

```go
func MaxCallRecvMsgSize(bytes int) CallOption
```

MaxCallRecvMsgSize returns a CallOption which sets the maximum message size in bytes the client can receive.

### func MaxCallSendMsgSize

```go
func MaxCallSendMsgSize(bytes int) CallOption
```

MaxCallSendMsgSize returns a CallOption which sets the maximum message size in bytes the client can send.

### func MaxRetryRPCBufferSize

```go
func MaxRetryRPCBufferSize(bytes int) CallOption
```

MaxRetryRPCBufferSize returns a CallOption that limits the amount of memory used for buffering this RPC's requests for retry purposes.

#### Experimental

Notice: This API is EXPERIMENTAL and may be changed or removed in a later release.

### func Peer

```go
func Peer(p *peer.Peer) CallOption
```

Peer returns a CallOption that retrieves peer information for a unary RPC. The peer field will be populated \*after\* the RPC completes.

### func PerRPCCredentials

```go
func PerRPCCredentials(creds credentials.PerRPCCredentials) CallOption
```

PerRPCCredentials returns a CallOption that sets credentials.PerRPCCredentials for a call.

### func Trailer

```go
func Trailer(md *metadata.MD) CallOption
```

Trailer returns a CallOptions that retrieves the trailer metadata for a unary RPC.

### func UseCompressor

```go
func UseCompressor(name string) CallOption
```

UseCompressor returns a CallOption which sets the compressor used when sending the request.  If WithCompressor is also set, UseCompressor has higher priority.

#### Experimental

Notice: This API is EXPERIMENTAL and may be changed or removed in a later release.

### func WaitForReady

```go
func WaitForReady(waitForReady bool) CallOption
```

WaitForReady configures the action to take when an RPC is attempted on broken connections or unreachable servers. If waitForReady is false and the connection is in the TRANSIENT\_FAILURE state, the RPC will fail immediately. Otherwise, the RPC client will block the call until a connection is available \(or the call is canceled or times out\) and will retry the call if it fails due to a transient error.  gRPC will not retry if data was written to the wire unless the server indicates it did not process the data.  Please refer to https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/wait-for-ready.md.

By default, RPCs don't "wait for ready".

## type ClientConn

ClientConn represents a virtual connection to a conceptual endpoint, to perform RPCs.

A ClientConn is free to have zero or more actual connections to the endpoint based on configuration, load, etc. It is also free to determine which actual endpoints to use and may change it every RPC, permitting client\-side load balancing.

A ClientConn encapsulates a range of functionality including name resolution, TCP connection establishment \(with retries and backoff\) and TLS handshakes. It also handles errors on established connections by re\-resolving the name and reconnecting.

```go
type ClientConn struct {
    // contains filtered or unexported fields
}
```

### func Dial

```go
func Dial(target string, opts ...DialOption) (*ClientConn, error)
```

Dial creates a client connection to the given target.

### func DialContext

```go
func DialContext(ctx context.Context, target string, opts ...DialOption) (conn *ClientConn, err error)
```

DialContext creates a client connection to the given target. By default, it's a non\-blocking dial \(the function won't wait for connections to be established, and connecting happens in the background\). To make it a blocking dial, use WithBlock\(\) dial option.

In the non\-blocking case, the ctx does not act against the connection. It only controls the setup steps.

In the blocking case, ctx can be used to cancel or expire the pending connection. Once this function returns, the cancellation and expiration of ctx will be noop. Users should call ClientConn.Close to terminate all the pending operations after this function returns.

The target name syntax is defined in https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/naming.md. e.g. to use dns resolver, a "dns:///" prefix should be applied to the target.

### func \(\*ClientConn\) Close

```go
func (cc *ClientConn) Close() error
```

Close tears down the ClientConn and all underlying connections.

### func \(\*ClientConn\) Connect

```go
func (cc *ClientConn) Connect()
```

Connect causes all subchannels in the ClientConn to attempt to connect if the channel is idle.  Does not wait for the connection attempts to begin before returning.

#### Experimental

Notice: This API is EXPERIMENTAL and may be changed or removed in a later release.

### func \(\*ClientConn\) GetMethodConfig

```go
func (cc *ClientConn) GetMethodConfig(method string) MethodConfig
```

GetMethodConfig gets the method config of the input method. If there's an exact match for input method \(i.e. /service/method\), we return the corresponding MethodConfig. If there isn't an exact match for the input method, we look for the service's default config under the service \(i.e /service/\) and then for the default for all services \(empty string\).

If there is a default MethodConfig for the service, we return it. Otherwise, we return an empty MethodConfig.

### func \(\*ClientConn\) GetState

```go
func (cc *ClientConn) GetState() connectivity.State
```

GetState returns the connectivity.State of ClientConn.

#### Experimental

Notice: This API is EXPERIMENTAL and may be changed or removed in a later release.

### func \(\*ClientConn\) Invoke

```go
func (cc *ClientConn) Invoke(ctx context.Context, method string, args, reply interface{}, opts ...CallOption) error
```

Invoke sends the RPC request on the wire and returns after response is received.  This is typically called by generated code.

All errors returned by Invoke are compatible with the status package.

### func \(\*ClientConn\) NewStream

```go
func (cc *ClientConn) NewStream(ctx context.Context, desc *StreamDesc, method string, opts ...CallOption) (ClientStream, error)
```

NewStream creates a new Stream for the client side. This is typically called by generated code. ctx is used for the lifetime of the stream.

To ensure resources are not leaked due to the stream returned, one of the following actions must be performed:

1. Call Close on the ClientConn. 2. Cancel the context provided. 3. Call RecvMsg until a non\-nil error is returned. A protobuf\-generated client\-streaming RPC, for instance, might use the helper function CloseAndRecv \(note that CloseSend does not Recv, therefore is not guaranteed to release all resources\). 4. Receive a non\-nil, non\-io.EOF error from Header or SendMsg.

If none of the above happen, a goroutine and a context will be leaked, and grpc will not call the optionally\-configured stats handler with a stats.End message.

### func \(\*ClientConn\) ResetConnectBackoff

```go
func (cc *ClientConn) ResetConnectBackoff()
```

ResetConnectBackoff wakes up all subchannels in transient failure and causes them to attempt another connection immediately.  It also resets the backoff times used for subsequent attempts regardless of the current state.

In general, this function should not be used.  Typical service or network outages result in a reasonable client reconnection strategy by default. However, if a previously unavailable network becomes available, this may be used to trigger an immediate reconnect.

#### Experimental

Notice: This API is EXPERIMENTAL and may be changed or removed in a later release.

### func \(\*ClientConn\) Target

```go
func (cc *ClientConn) Target() string
```

Target returns the target string of the ClientConn.

#### Experimental

Notice: This API is EXPERIMENTAL and may be changed or removed in a later release.

### func \(\*ClientConn\) WaitForStateChange

```go
func (cc *ClientConn) WaitForStateChange(ctx context.Context, sourceState connectivity.State) bool
```

WaitForStateChange waits until the connectivity.State of ClientConn changes from sourceState or ctx expires. A true value is returned in former case and false in latter.

#### Experimental

Notice: This API is EXPERIMENTAL and may be changed or removed in a later release.

## type ClientConnInterface

ClientConnInterface defines the functions clients need to perform unary and streaming RPCs.  It is implemented by \*ClientConn, and is only intended to be referenced by generated code.

```go
type ClientConnInterface interface {
    // Invoke performs a unary RPC and returns after the response is received
    // into reply.

    // NewStream begins a streaming RPC.
    NewStream(ctx context.Context, desc *StreamDesc, method string, opts ...CallOption) (ClientStream, error)
}
```

## type ClientStream

ClientStream defines the client\-side behavior of a streaming RPC.

All errors returned from ClientStream methods are compatible with the status package.

```go
type ClientStream interface {
    // Header returns the header metadata received from the server if there
    // is any. It blocks if the metadata is not ready to read.
    Header() (metadata.MD, error)
    // Trailer returns the trailer metadata from the server, if there is any.
    // It must only be called after stream.CloseAndRecv has returned, or
    // stream.Recv has returned a non-nil error (including io.EOF).
    Trailer() metadata.MD
    // CloseSend closes the send direction of the stream. It closes the stream
    // when non-nil error is met. It is also not safe to call CloseSend
    // concurrently with SendMsg.
    CloseSend() error
    // Context returns the context for this stream.
    //
    // It should not be called until after Header or RecvMsg has returned. Once
    // called, subsequent client-side retries are disabled.
    Context() context.Context
    // SendMsg is generally called by generated code. On error, SendMsg aborts
    // the stream. If the error was generated by the client, the status is
    // returned directly; otherwise, io.EOF is returned and the status of
    // the stream may be discovered using RecvMsg.
    //
    // SendMsg blocks until:
    //   - There is sufficient flow control to schedule m with the transport, or
    //   - The stream is done, or
    //   - The stream breaks.
    //
    // SendMsg does not wait until the message is received by the server. An
    // untimely stream closure may result in lost messages. To ensure delivery,
    // users should ensure the RPC completed successfully using RecvMsg.
    //
    // It is safe to have a goroutine calling SendMsg and another goroutine
    // calling RecvMsg on the same stream at the same time, but it is not safe
    // to call SendMsg on the same stream in different goroutines. It is also
    // not safe to call CloseSend concurrently with SendMsg.
    SendMsg(m interface{}) error
    // RecvMsg blocks until it receives a message into m or the stream is
    // done. It returns io.EOF when the stream completes successfully. On
    // any other error, the stream is aborted and the error contains the RPC
    // status.
    //
    // It is safe to have a goroutine calling SendMsg and another goroutine
    // calling RecvMsg on the same stream at the same time, but it is not
    // safe to call RecvMsg on the same stream in different goroutines.
    RecvMsg(m interface{}) error
}

### func \(\*Server\) Serve

```go
func (s *Server) Serve(lis net.Listener) error
```

Serve accepts incoming connections on the listener lis, creating a new ServerTransport and service goroutine for each. The service goroutines read gRPC requests and then call the registered handlers to reply to them. Serve returns when lis.Accept fails with fatal errors.  lis will be closed when this method returns. Serve will return a non\-nil error unless Stop or GracefulStop is called.

### func \(\*Server\) ServeHTTP

```go
func (s *Server) ServeHTTP(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request)
```

ServeHTTP implements the Go standard library's http.Handler interface by responding to the gRPC request r, by looking up the requested gRPC method in the gRPC server s.

The provided HTTP request must have arrived on an HTTP/2 connection. When using the Go standard library's server, practically this means that the Request must also have arrived over TLS.

To share one port \(such as 443 for https\) between gRPC and an existing http.Handler, use a root http.Handler such as:

```
if r.ProtoMajor == 2 && strings.HasPrefix(
	r.Header.Get("Content-Type"), "application/grpc") {
	grpcServer.ServeHTTP(w, r)
} else {
	yourMux.ServeHTTP(w, r)
}
```

Note that ServeHTTP uses Go's HTTP/2 server implementation which is totally separate from grpc\-go's HTTP/2 server. Performance and features may vary between the two paths. ServeHTTP does not support some gRPC features available through grpc\-go's HTTP/2 server.

### func MaxMsgSize

```go
func MaxMsgSize(m int) ServerOption
```

MaxMsgSize returns a ServerOption to set the max message size in bytes the server can receive. If this is not set, gRPC uses the default limit.

Deprecated: use MaxRecvMsgSize instead. Will be supported throughout 1.x.

### func MaxRecvMsgSize

### func RPCCompressor

```go
func RPCCompressor(cp Compressor) ServerOption
```

RPCCompressor returns a ServerOption that sets a compressor for outbound messages.  For backward compatibility, all outbound messages will be sent using this compressor, regardless of incoming message compression.

### func UnknownServiceHandler

```go
func UnknownServiceHandler(streamHandler StreamHandler) ServerOption
```

UnknownServiceHandler returns a ServerOption that allows for adding a custom unknown service handler. The provided method is a bidi\-streaming RPC service handler that will be invoked instead of returning the "unimplemented" gRPC error whenever a request is received for an unregistered service or method. The handling function and stream interceptor \(if set\) have full access to the ServerStream, including its Context.

### func WriteBufferSize

```go
func WriteBufferSize(s int) ServerOption
```

WriteBufferSize determines how much data can be batched before doing a write on the wire. The corresponding memory allocation for this buffer will be twice the size to keep syscalls low. The default value for this buffer is 32KB. Zero will disable the write buffer such that each write will be on underlying connection. Note: A Send call may not directly translate to a write.

## type ServerStream

ServerStream defines the server\-side behavior of a streaming RPC.

Errors returned from ServerStream methods are compatible with the status package.  However, the status code will often not match the RPC status as seen by the client application, and therefore, should not be relied upon for this purpose.

```go
type ServerStream interface {
    // SetHeader sets the header metadata. It may be called multiple times.
    // When call multiple times, all the provided metadata will be merged.
    // All the metadata will be sent out when one of the following happens:
    //  - ServerStream.SendHeader() is called;
    //  - The first response is sent out;
    //  - An RPC status is sent out (error or success).
    SetHeader(metadata.MD) error
    // SendHeader sends the header metadata.
    // The provided md and headers set by SetHeader() will be sent.
    // It fails if called multiple times.
    SendHeader(metadata.MD) error
    // SetTrailer sets the trailer metadata which will be sent with the RPC status.
    // When called more than once, all the provided metadata will be merged.
    SetTrailer(metadata.MD)
    // Context returns the context for this stream.
    Context() context.Context
    // SendMsg sends a message. On error, SendMsg aborts the stream and the
    // error is returned directly.
    //
    // SendMsg blocks until:
    //   - There is sufficient flow control to schedule m with the transport, or
    //   - The stream is done, or
    //   - The stream breaks.
    //
    // SendMsg does not wait until the message is received by the client. An
    // untimely stream closure may result in lost messages.
    //
    // It is safe to have a goroutine calling SendMsg and another goroutine
    // calling RecvMsg on the same stream at the same time, but it is not safe
    // to call SendMsg on the same stream in different goroutines.
    SendMsg(m interface{}) error
    // RecvMsg blocks until it receives a message into m or the stream is
    // done. It returns io.EOF when the client has performed a CloseSend. On
    // any non-EOF error, the stream is aborted and the error contains the
    // RPC status.
    //
    // It is safe to have a goroutine calling SendMsg and another goroutine
    // calling RecvMsg on the same stream at the same time, but it is not
    // safe to call RecvMsg on the same stream in different goroutines.
    RecvMsg(m interface{}) error
}
```

## type ServerTransportStream

ServerTransportStream is a minimal interface that a transport stream must implement. This can be used to mock an actual transport stream for tests of handler code that use, for example, grpc.SetHeader \(which requires some stream to be in context\).

See also NewContextWithServerTransportStream.

\# Experimental

Notice: This type is EXPERIMENTAL and may be changed or removed in a later release.

```go
type ServerTransportStream interface {
    Method() string
    SetHeader(md metadata.MD) error
    SendHeader(md metadata.MD) error
    SetTrailer(md metadata.MD) error
}
```

### func ServerTransportStreamFromContext

```go
func ServerTransportStreamFromContext(ctx context.Context) ServerTransportStream
```

ServerTransportStreamFromContext returns the ServerTransportStream saved in ctx. Returns nil if the given context has no stream associated with it \(which implies it is not an RPC invocation context\).

\# Experimental

Notice: This API is EXPERIMENTAL and may be changed or removed in a later release.

## type ServiceConfig

ServiceConfig is provided by the service provider and contains parameters for how clients that connect to the service should behave.

Deprecated: Users should not use this struct. Service config should be received through name resolver, as specified here https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/service_config.md

```go
type ServiceConfig struct {
    serviceconfig.Config

    // LB is the load balancer the service providers recommends.  This is
    // deprecated; lbConfigs is preferred.  If lbConfig and LB are both present,
    // lbConfig will be used.
    LB  *string

    // Methods contains a map for the methods in this service.  If there is an
    // exact match for a method (i.e. /service/method) in the map, use the
    // corresponding MethodConfig.  If there's no exact match, look for the
    // default config for the service (/service/) and use the corresponding
    // MethodConfig if it exists.  Otherwise, the method has no MethodConfig to
    // use.
    Methods map[string]MethodConfig
    // contains filtered or unexported fields
}
```

## type ServiceDesc

ServiceDesc represents an RPC service's specification.

```go
type ServiceDesc struct {
    ServiceName string
    // The pointer to the service interface. Used to check whether the user
    // provided implementation satisfies the interface requirements.
    HandlerType interface{}
    Methods     []MethodDesc
    Streams     []StreamDesc
    Metadata    interface{}
}
```

## type ServiceInfo

ServiceInfo contains unary RPC method info, streaming RPC method info and metadata for a service.

```go
type ServiceInfo struct {
    Methods []MethodInfo
    // Metadata is the metadata specified in ServiceDesc when registering service.
    Metadata interface{}
}
```

## type ServiceRegistrar

ServiceRegistrar wraps a single method that supports service registration. It enables users to pass concrete types other than grpc.Server to the service registration methods exported by the IDL generated code.

```go
type ServiceRegistrar interface {
    // RegisterService registers a service and its implementation to the
    // concrete type implementing this interface.  It may not be called
    // once the server has started serving.
    // desc describes the service and its methods and handlers. impl is the
    // service implementation which is passed to the method handlers.
    RegisterService(desc *ServiceDesc, impl interface{})
}
```

## type Stream

Stream defines the common interface a client or server stream has to satisfy.

Deprecated: See ClientStream and ServerStream documentation instead.

```go
type Stream interface {
    // Deprecated: See ClientStream and ServerStream documentation instead.
    Context() context.Context
    // Deprecated: See ClientStream and ServerStream documentation instead.
    SendMsg(m interface{}) error
    // Deprecated: See ClientStream and ServerStream documentation instead.
    RecvMsg(m interface{}) error
}
```

## type StreamClientInterceptor

StreamClientInterceptor intercepts the creation of a ClientStream. Stream interceptors can be specified as a DialOption, using WithStreamInterceptor\(\) or WithChainStreamInterceptor\(\), when creating a ClientConn. When a stream interceptor\(s\) is set on the ClientConn, gRPC delegates all stream creations to the interceptor, and it is the responsibility of the interceptor to call streamer.

desc contains a description of the stream. cc is the ClientConn on which the RPC was invoked. streamer is the handler to create a ClientStream and it is the responsibility of the interceptor to call it. opts contain all applicable call options, including defaults from the ClientConn as well as per\-call options.

StreamClientInterceptor may return a custom ClientStream to intercept all I/O operations. The returned error must be compatible with the status package.

```go
type StreamClientInterceptor func(ctx context.Context, desc *StreamDesc, cc *ClientConn, method string, streamer Streamer, opts ...CallOption) (ClientStream, error)
```

## type StreamDesc

StreamDesc represents a streaming RPC service's method specification.  Used on the server when registering services and on the client when initiating new streams.

```go
type StreamDesc struct {
    // StreamName and Handler are only used when registering handlers on a
    // server.
    StreamName string        // the name of the method excluding the service
    Handler    StreamHandler // the handler called for the method

    // ServerStreams and ClientStreams are used for registering handlers on a
    // server as well as defining RPC behavior when passed to NewClientStream
    // and ClientConn.NewStream.  At least one must be true.
    ServerStreams bool // indicates the server can perform streaming sends
    ClientStreams bool // indicates the client can perform streaming sends
}
```

## type StreamHandler

StreamHandler defines the handler called by gRPC server to complete the execution of a streaming RPC.

If a StreamHandler returns an error, it should either be produced by the status package, or be one of the context errors. Otherwise, gRPC will use codes.Unknown as the status code and err.Error\(\) as the status message of the RPC.

```go
type StreamHandler func(srv interface{}, stream ServerStream) error
```

## type StreamServerInfo

StreamServerInfo consists of various information about a streaming RPC on server side. All per\-rpc information may be mutated by the interceptor.

```go
type StreamServerInfo struct {
    // FullMethod is the full RPC method string, i.e., /package.service/method.
    FullMethod string
    // IsClientStream indicates whether the RPC is a client streaming RPC.
    IsClientStream bool
    // IsServerStream indicates whether the RPC is a server streaming RPC.
    IsServerStream bool
}
```

## type StreamServerInterceptor

StreamServerInterceptor provides a hook to intercept the execution of a streaming RPC on the server. info contains all the information of this RPC the interceptor can operate on. And handler is the service method implementation. It is the responsibility of the interceptor to invoke handler to complete the RPC.

```go
type StreamServerInterceptor func(srv interface{}, ss ServerStream, info *StreamServerInfo, handler StreamHandler) error
```

## type Streamer

Streamer is called by StreamClientInterceptor to create a ClientStream.

```go
type Streamer func(ctx context.Context, desc *StreamDesc, cc *ClientConn, method string, opts ...CallOption) (ClientStream, error)
```

## type TrailerCallOption

TrailerCallOption is a CallOption for collecting response trailer metadata. The metadata field will be populated \*after\* the RPC completes.

### Experimental

Notice: This type is EXPERIMENTAL and may be changed or removed in a later release.

```go
type TrailerCallOption struct {
    TrailerAddr *metadata.MD
}
```

## type UnaryClientInterceptor

UnaryClientInterceptor intercepts the execution of a unary RPC on the client. Unary interceptors can be specified as a DialOption, using WithUnaryInterceptor\(\) or WithChainUnaryInterceptor\(\), when creating a ClientConn. When a unary interceptor\(s\) is set on a ClientConn, gRPC delegates all unary RPC invocations to the interceptor, and it is the responsibility of the interceptor to call invoker to complete the processing of the RPC.

method is the RPC name. req and reply are the corresponding request and response messages. cc is the ClientConn on which the RPC was invoked. invoker is the handler to complete the RPC and it is the responsibility of the interceptor to call it. opts contain all applicable call options, including defaults from the ClientConn as well as per\-call options.

The returned error must be compatible with the status package.

```go
type UnaryClientInterceptor func(ctx context.Context, method string, req, reply interface{}, cc *ClientConn, invoker UnaryInvoker, opts ...CallOption) error
```

## type UnaryHandler

UnaryHandler defines the handler invoked by UnaryServerInterceptor to complete the normal execution of a unary RPC.

If a UnaryHandler returns an error, it should either be produced by the status package, or be one of the context errors. Otherwise, gRPC will use codes.Unknown as the status code and err.Error\(\) as the status message of the RPC.

```go
type UnaryHandler func(ctx context.Context, req interface{}) (interface{}, error)
```

## type UnaryInvoker

UnaryInvoker is called by UnaryClientInterceptor to complete RPCs.

```go
type UnaryInvoker func(ctx context.Context, method string, req, reply interface{}, cc *ClientConn, opts ...CallOption) error
```

## type UnaryServerInfo

UnaryServerInfo consists of various information about a unary RPC on server side. All per\-rpc information may be mutated by the interceptor.

```go
type UnaryServerInfo struct {
    // Server is the service implementation the user provides. This is read-only.
    Server interface{}
    // FullMethod is the full RPC method string, i.e., /package.service/method.
    FullMethod string
}
```

## type UnaryServerInterceptor

UnaryServerInterceptor provides a hook to intercept the execution of a unary RPC on the server. info contains all the information of this RPC the interceptor can operate on. And handler is the wrapper of the service method implementation. It is the responsibility of the interceptor to invoke handler to complete the RPC.

```go
type UnaryServerInterceptor func(ctx context.Context, req interface{}, info *UnaryServerInfo, handler UnaryHandler) (resp interface{}, err error)
```
