# backoff

```go
import "github.com/vmware/service-level-indicator-exporter-for-kafka/vendor/google.golang.org/grpc/backoff"
```

Package backoff provides configuration options for backoff.

More details can be found at: https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/connection-backoff.md.

All APIs in this package are experimental.

## Variables

DefaultConfig is a backoff configuration with the default values specfied at https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/connection-backoff.md.

This should be useful for callers who want to configure backoff with non\-default values only for a subset of the options.

```go
var DefaultConfig = Config{
    BaseDelay:  1.0 * time.Second,
    Multiplier: 1.6,
    Jitter:     0.2,
    MaxDelay:   120 * time.Second,
}
```

## type Config

Config defines the configuration options for backoff.

```go
type Config struct {
    // BaseDelay is the amount of time to backoff after the first failure.
    BaseDelay time.Duration
    // Multiplier is the factor with which to multiply backoffs after a
    // failed retry. Should ideally be greater than 1.
    Multiplier float64
    // Jitter is the factor with which backoffs are randomized.
    Jitter float64
    // MaxDelay is the upper bound of backoff delay.
    MaxDelay time.Duration
}
```
