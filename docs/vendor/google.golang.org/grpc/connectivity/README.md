Package connectivity defines connectivity semantics. For details, see https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/connectivity-semantics-and-api.md.

## type ServingMode

ServingMode indicates the current mode of operation of the server.

Only xDS enabled gRPC servers currently report their serving mode.

```go
type ServingMode int
```

```go
const (
    // ServingModeStarting indicates that the server is starting up.
    ServingModeStarting ServingMode = iota
    // ServingModeServing indicates that the server contains all required
    // configuration and is serving RPCs.
    ServingModeServing
    // ServingModeNotServing indicates that the server is not accepting new
    // connections. Existing connections will be closed gracefully, allowing
    // in-progress RPCs to complete. A server enters this mode when it does not
    // contain the required configuration to serve RPCs.
    ServingModeNotServing
)
```

### func \(ServingMode\) String

```go
func (s ServingMode) String() string
```

## type State

State indicates the state of connectivity. It can be the state of a ClientConn or SubConn.

```go
type State int
```

```go
const (
    // Idle indicates the ClientConn is idle.
    Idle State = iota
    // Connecting indicates the ClientConn is connecting.
    Connecting
    // Ready indicates the ClientConn is ready for work.
    Ready
    // TransientFailure indicates the ClientConn has seen a failure but expects to recover.
    TransientFailure
    // Shutdown indicates the ClientConn has started shutting down.
    Shutdown
)
```

### func \(State\) String

```go
func (s State) String() string
```
