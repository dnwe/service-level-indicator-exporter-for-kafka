## Constants

Name is the name registered for the gzip compressor.

```go
const Name = "gzip"
```

## func SetLevel

```go
func SetLevel(level int) error
```

SetLevel updates the registered gzip compressor to use the compression level specified \(gzip.HuffmanOnly is not supported\). NOTE: this function must only be called during initialization time \(i.e. in an init\(\) function\), and is not thread\-safe.

The error returned will be nil if the specified level is valid.
