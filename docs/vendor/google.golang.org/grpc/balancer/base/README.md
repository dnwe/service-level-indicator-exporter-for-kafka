# base

```go
import "github.com/vmware/service-level-indicator-exporter-for-kafka/vendor/google.golang.org/grpc/balancer/base"
```

Package base defines a balancer base that can be used to build balancers with different picking algorithms.

The base balancer creates a new SubConn for each resolved address. The provided picker will only be notified about READY SubConns.

This package is the base of round\_robin balancer, its purpose is to be used to build round\_robin like balancers with complex picking algorithms. Balancers with more complicated logic should try to implement a balancer builder from scratch.

All APIs in this package are experimental.

## Variables

NewErrPickerV2 is temporarily defined for backward compatibility reasons.

Deprecated: use NewErrPicker instead.

```go
var NewErrPickerV2 = NewErrPicker
```

## func NewBalancerBuilder

```go
func NewBalancerBuilder(name string, pb PickerBuilder, config Config) balancer.Builder
```

NewBalancerBuilder returns a base balancer builder configured by the provided config.

## func NewErrPicker

```go
func NewErrPicker(err error) balancer.Picker
```

NewErrPicker returns a Picker that always returns err on Pick\(\).

## type Config

Config contains the config info about the base balancer builder.

```go
type Config struct {
    // HealthCheck indicates whether health checking should be enabled for this specific balancer.
    HealthCheck bool
}
```

## type PickerBuildInfo

PickerBuildInfo contains information needed by the picker builder to construct a picker.

```go
type PickerBuildInfo struct {
    // ReadySCs is a map from all ready SubConns to the Addresses used to
    // create them.
    ReadySCs map[balancer.SubConn]SubConnInfo
}
```

## type PickerBuilder

PickerBuilder creates balancer.Picker.

```go
type PickerBuilder interface {
    // Build returns a picker that will be used by gRPC to pick a SubConn.
    Build(info PickerBuildInfo) balancer.Picker
}
```

## type SubConnInfo

SubConnInfo contains information about a SubConn created by the base balancer.

```go
type SubConnInfo struct {
    Address resolver.Address // the address used to create this SubConn
}
```
