# pragma

```go
import "github.com/vmware/service-level-indicator-exporter-for-kafka/vendor/google.golang.org/protobuf/internal/pragma"
```

Package pragma provides types that can be embedded into a struct to statically enforce or prevent certain language properties.

## Index

- [type DoNotCompare](<#type-donotcompare>)
- [type DoNotCopy](<#type-donotcopy>)
- [type DoNotImplement](<#type-donotimplement>)
- [type NoUnkeyedLiterals](<#type-nounkeyedliterals>)


## type DoNotCompare

DoNotCompare can be embedded in a struct to prevent comparability.

```go
type DoNotCompare [0]func()
```

## type DoNotCopy

DoNotCopy can be embedded in a struct to help prevent shallow copies. This does not rely on a Go language feature, but rather a special case within the vet checker.

See https://golang.org/issues/8005.

```go
type DoNotCopy [0]sync.Mutex
```

## type DoNotImplement

DoNotImplement can be embedded in an interface to prevent trivial implementations of the interface.

This is useful to prevent unauthorized implementations of an interface so that it can be extended in the future for any protobuf language changes.

```go
type DoNotImplement interface{ ProtoInternal(DoNotImplement) }
```

## type NoUnkeyedLiterals

NoUnkeyedLiterals can be embedded in a struct to prevent unkeyed literals.

```go
type NoUnkeyedLiterals struct{}
```
