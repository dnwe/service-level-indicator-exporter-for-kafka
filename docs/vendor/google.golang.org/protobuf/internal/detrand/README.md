# detrand

```go
import "github.com/vmware/service-level-indicator-exporter-for-kafka/vendor/google.golang.org/protobuf/internal/detrand"
```

Package detrand provides deterministically random functionality.

The pseudo\-randomness of these functions is seeded by the program binary itself and guarantees that the output does not change within a program, while ensuring that the output is unstable across different builds.

## func Bool

```go
func Bool() bool
```

Bool returns a deterministically random boolean.

## func Disable

```go
func Disable()
```

Disable disables detrand such that all functions returns the zero value. This function is not concurrent\-safe and must be called during program init.

## func Intn

```go
func Intn(n int) int
```

Intn returns a deterministically random integer between 0 and n\-1, inclusive.
