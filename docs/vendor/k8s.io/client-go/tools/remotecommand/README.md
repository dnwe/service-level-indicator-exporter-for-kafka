# remotecommand

```go
import "k8s.io/client-go/tools/remotecommand"
```

Package remotecommand adds support for executing commands in containers, with support for separate stdin, stdout, and stderr streams, as well as TTY.

## type Executor

Executor is an interface for transporting shell\-style streams.

```go
type Executor interface {
    // Stream initiates the transport of the standard shell streams. It will transport any
    // non-nil stream to a remote system, and return an error if a problem occurs. If tty
    // is set, the stderr stream is not used (raw TTY manages stdout and stderr over the
    // stdout stream).
    Stream(options StreamOptions) error
}
```

### func NewSPDYExecutor

```go
func NewSPDYExecutor(config *restclient.Config, method string, url *url.URL) (Executor, error)
```

NewSPDYExecutor connects to the provided server and upgrades the connection to multiplexed bidirectional streams.

### func NewSPDYExecutorForProtocols

```go
func NewSPDYExecutorForProtocols(transport http.RoundTripper, upgrader spdy.Upgrader, method string, url *url.URL, protocols ...string) (Executor, error)
```

NewSPDYExecutorForProtocols connects to the provided server and upgrades the connection to multiplexed bidirectional streams using only the provided protocols. Exposed for testing, most callers should use NewSPDYExecutor or NewSPDYExecutorForTransports.

### func NewSPDYExecutorForTransports

```go
func NewSPDYExecutorForTransports(transport http.RoundTripper, upgrader spdy.Upgrader, method string, url *url.URL) (Executor, error)
```

NewSPDYExecutorForTransports connects to the provided server using the given transport, upgrades the response using the given upgrader to multiplexed bidirectional streams.

## type StreamOptions

StreamOptions holds information pertaining to the current streaming session: input/output streams, if the client is requesting a TTY, and a terminal size queue to support terminal resizing.

```go
type StreamOptions struct {
    Stdin             io.Reader
    Stdout            io.Writer
    Stderr            io.Writer
    Tty               bool
    TerminalSizeQueue TerminalSizeQueue
}
```

## type TerminalSize

TerminalSize represents the width and height of a terminal.

```go
type TerminalSize struct {
    Width  uint16
    Height uint16
}
```

## type TerminalSizeQueue

TerminalSizeQueue is capable of returning terminal resize events as they occur.

```go
type TerminalSizeQueue interface {
    // Next returns the new terminal size after the terminal has been resized. It returns nil when
    // monitoring has been stopped.
    Next() *TerminalSize
}
```
