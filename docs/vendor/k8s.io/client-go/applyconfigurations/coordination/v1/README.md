## type LeaseApplyConfiguration

LeaseApplyConfiguration represents an declarative configuration of the Lease type for use with apply.

```go
type LeaseApplyConfiguration struct {
    v1.TypeMetaApplyConfiguration    `json:",inline"`
    *v1.ObjectMetaApplyConfiguration `json:"metadata,omitempty"`
    Spec                             *LeaseSpecApplyConfiguration `json:"spec,omitempty"`
}
```

### func ExtractLease

```go
func ExtractLease(lease *apicoordinationv1.Lease, fieldManager string) (*LeaseApplyConfiguration, error)
```

ExtractLease extracts the applied configuration owned by fieldManager from lease. If no managedFields are found in lease for fieldManager, a LeaseApplyConfiguration is returned with only the Name, Namespace \(if applicable\), APIVersion and Kind populated. It is possible that no managed fields were found for because other field managers have taken ownership of all the fields previously owned by fieldManager, or because the fieldManager never owned fields any fields. lease must be a unmodified Lease API object that was retrieved from the Kubernetes API. ExtractLease provides a way to perform a extract/modify\-in\-place/apply workflow. Note that an extracted apply configuration will contain fewer fields than what the fieldManager previously applied if another fieldManager has updated or force applied any of the previously applied fields. Experimental\!

### func ExtractLeaseStatus
