## func Negotiate

```go
func Negotiate(upgrader Upgrader, client *http.Client, req *http.Request, protocols ...string) (httpstream.Connection, string, error)
```

Negotiate opens a connection to a remote server and attempts to negotiate a SPDY connection. Upon success, it returns the connection and the protocol selected by the server. The client transport must use the upgradeRoundTripper \- see RoundTripperFor.

## func NewDialer

```go
func NewDialer(upgrader Upgrader, client *http.Client, method string, url *url.URL) httpstream.Dialer
```

NewDialer will create a dialer that connects to the provided URL and upgrades the connection to SPDY.

## type Upgrader

Upgrader validates a response from the server after a SPDY upgrade.

```go
type Upgrader interface {
    // NewConnection validates the response and creates a new Connection.
    NewConnection(resp *http.Response) (httpstream.Connection, error)
}
```

### func RoundTripperFor

```go
func RoundTripperFor(config *restclient.Config) (http.RoundTripper, Upgrader, error)
```

RoundTripperFor returns a round tripper and upgrader to use with SPDY.
